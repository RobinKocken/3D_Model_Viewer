  description: The reference used was a Canon eos 250d dslr camera, however some
    liberties have been taken to save time and resources. the camera has taken ~8
    hours to make, including mesh and textures. 3 textures were made, each 2056x2056,
    and the camera consists of 3 objects in total.
